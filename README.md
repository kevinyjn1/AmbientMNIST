## üéØ Motivation

The growing demand for intelligent IoT devices calls for ultra-low-power systems that can operate without batteries. Ambient energy harvesting, which draws power from sources like light or RF signals, offers a sustainable solution‚Äîeliminating the need for battery replacement and enabling long-term deployment in remote areas.

Yet, deploying neural networks on such systems is challenging due to limited memory and intermittent power. The MSP430FR5994, with its non-volatile FRAM and low-power design, provides a suitable platform to explore these constraints.

As a proof-of-concept, we implement a lightweight MNIST classifier to demonstrate that neural inference is possible under intermittent, harvested power. While MNIST is a simple task, it effectively validates the feasibility of energy-autonomous AI at the extreme edge.

## üìñ Project Description
To execute the model under intermittent power conditions, we implemented the inference logic using the SONIC framework. SONIC enables reliable DNN execution on energy-harvesting devices by maintaining two alternating buffers for intermediate feature maps, allowing progress to continue seamlessly across power cycles.

We integrated the layer-by-layer inference logic into main.c, ensuring that each operation fits within the available energy budget and memory. By leveraging SONIC‚Äôs double-buffering and task-based checkpointing mechanism, the system can recover from power loss at fine-grained computation boundaries without restarting the entire inference process.

The overall workflow is as follows:

1. **Lightweight CNN & Header Generation**  
   - Train a 2-conv, 2-FC CNN on MNIST in TensorFlow, then quantize to 5-bit fixed-point.  
   - Run `AmbientMNIST_script.ipynb` to serialize each weight/bias array into C header files (`*.h`).

2. **SONIC Framework Integration**  
   - Place headers under `apps/my_mnist/params/` in the SONIC repo.  
   - In `main.c`, implement each DNN layer as a SONIC task, using the framework‚Äôs dual-buffer scheme:  
     - **Buffer A/B** alternate reading/writing of intermediate feature maps.  
     - After each small ‚Äútask,‚Äù SONIC checkpoints state to FRAM via sparse undo-logging.

3. **Compile & Deploy**  
   - Build with `make my_mnist` to generate `my_mnist.out`.  
   - Flash to the MSP430FR5994 using TI UniFlash.

4. **Robust Inference under Intermittent Power**  
   - A tiny solar panel charges a storage capacitor; when voltage dips, SONIC seamlessly retries the next task on recharge.  
   - At the end of inference, results are printed over UART for validation.
