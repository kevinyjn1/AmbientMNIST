The MSP430FR5994 board sits in complete darkness with its on-board LED off. Shining a flashlight onto the attached solar panel immediately powers the MCU‚Äîat which point it runs the blink routine and you see the LED toggle. Removing the light cuts energy harvesting, the MCU shuts down, and the LED goes dark again. This on/off cycle clearly demonstrates intermittent, energy-harvesting‚Äìdriven operation.

## üéØ Motivation

The growing demand for intelligent IoT devices calls for ultra-low-power systems that can operate without batteries. Ambient energy harvesting, which draws power from sources like light or RF signals, offers a sustainable solution‚Äîeliminating the need for battery replacement and enabling long-term deployment in remote areas.

Yet, deploying neural networks on such systems is challenging due to limited memory and intermittent power. The MSP430FR5994, with its non-volatile FRAM and low-power design, provides a suitable platform to explore these constraints.

As a proof-of-concept, we implement a lightweight MNIST classifier to demonstrate that neural inference is possible under intermittent, harvested power. While MNIST is a simple task, it effectively validates the feasibility of energy-autonomous AI at the extreme edge.

## üìñ Project Description
To execute the model under intermittent power conditions, we implemented the inference logic using the SONIC framework. SONIC enables reliable DNN execution on energy-harvesting devices by maintaining two alternating buffers for intermediate feature maps, allowing progress to continue seamlessly across power cycles.

We integrated the layer-by-layer inference logic into main.c, ensuring that each operation fits within the available energy budget and memory. By leveraging SONIC‚Äôs double-buffering and task-based checkpointing mechanism, the system can recover from power loss at fine-grained computation boundaries without restarting the entire inference process.

The overall workflow is as follows:

1. **Lightweight CNN & Header Generation**  
   - Train a 2-conv, 2-FC CNN on MNIST in TensorFlow, then quantize to 5-bit fixed-point.  
   - Run `AmbientMNIST_script.ipynb` to serialize each weight/bias array into C header files (`*.h`).

2. **SONIC Framework Integration**  
   - Place headers under `apps/my_mnist/params/` in the SONIC repo.  
   - In `main.c`, implement each DNN layer as a SONIC task, using the framework‚Äôs dual-buffer scheme:  
     - **Buffer A/B** alternate reading/writing of intermediate feature maps.  
     - After each small ‚Äútask,‚Äù SONIC checkpoints state to FRAM via sparse undo-logging.

3. **Compile & Deploy**  
   - Build with `make my_mnist` to generate `my_mnist.out`.  
   - Flash to the MSP430FR5994 using TI UniFlash.

4. **Robust Inference under Intermittent Power**  
   - A tiny solar panel charges a storage capacitor; when voltage dips, SONIC seamlessly retries the next task on recharge.  
   - At the end of inference, results are printed over UART for validation.
